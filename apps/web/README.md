# Chess Openings

Preact + TypeScript + SCSS app, scaffolded by the `scaffold-preact` skill.

## Run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173
pnpm build      # → dist/
pnpm preview    # serve dist/
pnpm lint       # oxlint
pnpm typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
```

## Layout

- `src/` — app code:
  - `pages/<PageName>/` — page-level / route views (one folder per page)
  - `components/<feature-or-component>/` — feature & UI components (one folder each)
  - `components/common/<Component>/` — primitive / core shared components (Button, Input, Modal, …)
  - `app/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `services/`, `types/`
- `styles/` — global SCSS (variables, mixins, responsive, reset, themes)
- `config/` — all tool configs (vite, tsconfig, oxlint, Dockerfile)
- `public/` — static assets served as-is
- `.dockerignore` lives at the project root (Docker requires it at the build-context root — it's the one config file that can't live in `config/`).

## Conventions

- **Placement** — keep pages and components separate: a **page** (route/screen) goes in `src/pages/<PageName>/`; a **feature/UI component** in `src/components/<feature-or-component>/`; a **primitive/core "common" component** (Button, Input, Modal, …) in `src/components/common/<Component>/`. Don't dump everything flat into `components/`.
- **Components** are presentational and composable. State lives in hooks.
- **`lib/`** is pure — no Preact imports. Put utilities, formatters, parsers here.
- **`services/`** is side-effectful — API clients, storage, service workers.
- **Styling**: traditional SCSS — one `Component.scss` per component, imported once at the top of the component (`import './Component.scss';`) and referenced with real class names (`class="card"`). Hierarchical/nested selectors, no CSS modules, no CSS-in-JS. Global design tokens live in `styles/_variables.scss` as CSS custom properties. Use inline `style={{...}}` only for values computed from runtime state (e.g., a transform driven by mouse position).
- **Theming**: swap themes by setting `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = 'dark'`. Overrides live in `styles/_themes.scss`.

## Bundler

This project uses **Vite 8**, which ships the Rolldown (Rust) bundler built in — no aliasing or bridge package needed. `pnpm dev` is near-instant; production builds tree-shake aggressively.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -f config/Dockerfile -t web .
docker run -p 8080:80 web
```

## Extending

- **Router**: add `preact-router`, put route components under `src/pages/`.
- **State**: pick one as the app grows — `@preact/signals`, context + hooks, or `zustand` via `preact-zustand`.
- **Service worker**: scaffold lives in `src/services/sw/` if enabled. Registration is opt-in — call `registerServiceWorker()` from `main.tsx` when ready.
- **Animations**: `motion` (npm) works great with Preact — `import { motion } from 'motion/react'`.
